# Module-10-Advanced-SQL

## Assigment Files

The assigment has been complted in two parts. Part 1 is analysis and exporation of climate data. This has been completed on a Jupyter Notebook called 'climate_starter.ipynb'. The code has been annotated to be able to easily follow and the relevant outputs are shown in line. The two plots are displyed and they have also been saved as PNG images in the 'outputs folder.

Part 2 involves design of a climate app which is a API built using Flask. The app is able to query the 'hawaii' database. The code is written in the python script in the file named 'app.py'. The code has been annotaed to follow along.

## Marking Scheme Deviation

In the precipitation analysis the requirement was to use the dataframe ```plot``` function. To replicate a similar looking bar chart as shown in the requirement section, extensive formatting was required. Hence a decision was used to use Matplitlib ```plt``` rather than the Pandas ```plot``` function. However for the histogram the Pandas ```plot``` function was used.
